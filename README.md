==============================

The Plan

* Playing with Data::Query (the new innards)
* Your own DBIx::Class code with access to help
* A talk or two maybe.

### How many?

* Breakfast/snacks/lunch
* Internet, if the hall has it available
* Local wifi network + server with CPAN, preloaded repos on.

### Attendee pays

Notes/Status
------------

Jess' random planning notes go here, they will change, feel free to read/ask about:

* Hall / community hall etc hire:
    * Village halls fairly cheap? (Deposit? see Market Lavington)
    * Distance from travel hub to consider, eg train station/airport?
    * Hall preferable to pub function room

* Network/amenities:
    * Get a server, put minicpan on it, give people accounts and allow them to github pull etc their stuff before we go
    * Attach a wifi access point, that's our network
    * We may or may not find a hall with networking
    * Tables, chairs - included in hall?

* Food etc:
    * Provide breakfast, drinks, snacks/lunch
    * Dinner - local pub or similar?
    * = have it in town with access to shops/pub, not too far from hotels?

* Theme:
    * DBIx::Class usage/tools/docs/tests etc?

* Accommodation:

    * Travelodge
    * Jury's Inn

* Notes?
    * single day? no accommodation / overnighting needed?
    * BBQ food? (decent time of year)
    * co-working space - Basepoint etc?
    * Wendy/Liz?
    * Swag? stickers or something
    * nearby shopping for forgotten things
