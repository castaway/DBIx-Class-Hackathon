### What for? (Suggestions)

* Hacking on DBIx::Class itself: A hefty prepared collection of tickets will be available to contribute to <quote: ribasushi>
* Ribasushi has volunteered a couple talks on DBIx::Class architechure (deeply technical), mebbe we can get mst as well..
* Revitalize the effort to documenting DBIC in a more accessible manner
* Sorting out the website
* Playing with Data::Query (the new query language innards)
* Work on your own DBIC-based code with access to instant help from core maintainers

### How many?

* The booked venue is a community hall and should have tables for at least 15 (they tell me). I've put 20 on the tickets so that we can plan for food etc. Will worry about extra if that problem arrives. Please book early to help plan!
